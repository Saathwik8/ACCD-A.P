        <h4>This articles addresses this while explaining Example 3 - programming environment 
          that best supported the display of true 3D perspectives during manipulation. 
          I found this quote equally interesting as each prototype that is made is designed 
          to test a specific hypothesis. And it is interesting how prototypes different in form, 
          shape, ordination can test aspects of a design and then those learning come to gather 
          to correct the final form. This final form which itself can have a completely differ 
          design than the prototypes yet the technique of making them enables one to use the 
          learnings and refine product. Though this is  well understood concept, it is less spoken 
          about, and the article mentioning it seemed very interesting. </h4>

        <h4>I found this quote interesting as it offers an operational definition of what a prototype is. 
          Especially when it mentions "regardless of the medium'', it makes the application of 
          the definition flexible. Usually, prototypes are used to test and understand systems 
          before being released to customers. Thus the capability of prototypes to be medium-independent 
          makes them very powerful as tools. Simple materials are used to provide an understanding of 
          the object of testing.  </h4>

        <h4>Prototypes being an open ended concept allows for a very interesting process. 
          However the dimension and the quality of the prototype enables more comprehensive test results. 
          If a product needs to be tested for specific outcomes, the kind of prototype really matters, 
          E.g., while testing how a material texture feels,  the surface of the prototype also must 
          be using the materials as the main product and should also replicate the products dimensions. 
          Sometimes It becomes imperative to use the correct design, form, material and other test parameters 
          to be representative of the final product. </h4>

        <h4>This article addresses this while explaining Example 3 that explored programming 
          environments that best supported the display of true 3D perspectives during manipulation. 
          This quote indicates that each prototype is designed to test a specific hypothesis. 
          And it is interesting how prototypes different in form, shape, ordination can test aspects 
          of a design and those learnings enable re-iterations that lead to the final refined form. 
          This final form itself can have a completely different design than the prototypes. Though 
          this is a well understood concept, it is less spoken about, and the article mentioning it 
          seemed very interesting. </h4>

        <h4>I found this a very interesting quiet as it raised a question “what does it take to design instruction manuals”. 
            To teach someone how to design or create something in itself is a very difficult process and how asa designers we 
            need to breakdown how that translation happens. It also calls to how some companies do it very well. For example Ikea. 
            Their entire instruction manual is designed in such a way that anyone can understand it. As designers this also calls 
            to how we design simple interactions that enable people to understand how to use our designs. Tutorials, startup and 
            logo systems, they themselves need to be doe carefully as all meta design processes primarily enable people get a better
             understanding of the design. </h4>

        <h4>Emphasis is one of the key things in design and the article mentioning this was very interesting to read. 
            The the article furthers shows the example of the Volkswagen Beetle printed in different sizes within an 
            otherwise empty canvas, it made it very clear how to create emphasis by using the sheer quality of scale. 
            As designers I do feel emphasizing the features and aspects of the design really help in navigating the 
            user to the correct parts of the design. It can also be the key to make a design from unintuitive to intuitive.</h4>

        <h4>It is difficult to emulate the duchess of ay tactile feedback. 
            Having material that one can physically touch will always be differs from a digital surface. 
            Though we all hold screens and now are always accessible to one - the print has its niche market that sometimes cannot be escaped. 
            In places that are not so well exposed to the technology still run on print and in order to create impact 
            I feel designers must know how to utilize this form as well. However - print does give a lot of restrictions. 
            It’s not dynamic. The content not be changed when needed and it is only static in nature. It is also damageable 
            because it is prone to all the physical constraints. Keeping these in mind as well, I feel designers must consider
             when they use what medium and how the most impact can be made.

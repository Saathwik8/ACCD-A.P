        <i>But the main problem with the virtual assistant is that it fosters an approach to the world that 
            is literally thoughtless, leaving users disinclined to sit out any particularly prolonged frustration 
            of desire, and ever less critical about the processes that result in the satisfaction of their needs and wants. </i></p>

        <h4>Virtual assist though very helpful, in the longer run I do feel can cause unexpected harm. 
            As mentioned “world that is literally thoughtless” is the primary fear that I also Carry about them. 
            As they enable the concept of instant information and gratification, the lack of it can equally cause 
            frustration and anxiety which might be a scenario we need to consider. Slowly, humans will stop to 
            process a few simple thing by themselves and that level of support or dependencies can reduce the amount 
            of capability of an individual. Not training our minds in simple things can result in a lowered sense of 
            awarness of the mind as well.

        <h4>This quote I found interesting as it talks about a very common and popular topic called 
            security - something that the current generation is really needing. The article does talk 
            though about how these system and their maintenance, repair and its simple understand is only 
            accessible to a niche group of people. This is itself I feel is dangerous as a common person 
            who dosn’t have the control of the security of his devices is actually very vulnerable. 
            System used for security need to be more simple in understanding as the lack of it means that 
            despite having security systems it dosn’t enable the user, fundamental to delivering the security 
            that it Is made for. Sure, it does open a maker of people who will not be skilled in this job 
            but not many can get access to such people and such dependence for security systems is not advisable as well. 
            The article mentions most of this and throws light onto these aspects, 
            which s why I found it interesting as well. </h4>

        <i>However thoroughly sensors might be deployed in a city, they’ll only ever capture 
            the qualities about the world that are amenable to capture. As the architect and 
            critical-data scholar Laura Kurgan has argued, “we measure the things that are easy 
            to measure ... the things that are cheap to measure,”33 and this suggests that sensors, 
            however widely deployed, will only ever yield a partial picture of the world. </i></p>

        <h4>I had personally worked on a city planning project back in 2016 and a major issue 
            we faced was to understand what kinds of metrics must we be measuring in order to 
            increase the efficiency of a system. It is interesting to notice that the article also 
            says that we only measure the variables that are immediately Abe to access and not actually 
            what are needed to develop insight. This primary leads into understanding what is to be measured, 
            how to generate insight ad how can we as designers create systems that generate insights and no 
            just represent data that is normally collected. How does one create representations from simple 
            logging that enable individuals to derive insight. In both, the leanings we had and the systems 
            mentioned in the article, it’s not about relying sensors and having a lot of system that capture 
            the data but it is how the data can be used for analysis and how that can help in improving systems. 
            It also calls to how do we start to develop better sensors that give us more accurate and diverse 
            sets of readings that can potentially give us further insights into systems.

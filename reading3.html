        <i>But the main problem with the virtual assistant is that it fosters an approach to the world that 
            is literally thoughtless, leaving users disinclined to sit out any particularly prolonged frustration 
            of desire, and ever less critical about the processes that result in the satisfaction of their needs and wants. </i></p>

        <h4>Virtual assistants - though very helpful - in the longer run can cause unexpected harm. 
          As mentioned “world that is literally thoughtless” is the primary fear that I also carry about them. 
          As they enable the concept of instant information and instant gratification, the lack of it 
          can equally cause frustration and anxiety which might be a scenario we need to consider in 
          future design interactions. Slowly, humans will stop to process a few simple things by 
          themselves and that level of support or dependency can stunt individual capability. Not 
          training our minds in simple things can result in a lowered sense of awareness of the mind as well.

          is only accessible to a niche group of people. This in itself is dangerous as a common person who dont 
          have the control of the security devices is kept very vulnerable to a lot of damage . Systems used for 
          security need to be more simple in understanding as the lack of it means that despite having security 
          systems it doesn't enable the user.  Fundamentally, the lack of such an intuitive system will make sure 
          it does not deliver the security that it Is made for. Sure, it does open a market of people who will 
          now be skilled in this job but not many can get access to such people and such dependence for security 
          systems is not advisable as well.</h4>

        <i>However thoroughly sensors might be deployed in a city, they’ll only ever capture 
            the qualities about the world that are amenable to capture. As the architect and 
            critical-data scholar Laura Kurgan has argued, “we measure the things that are easy 
            to measure ... the things that are cheap to measure,”33 and this suggests that sensors, 
            however widely deployed, will only ever yield a partial picture of the world. </i></p>

        <h4>I had personally worked on a city planning project back in 2016 and a major issue we 
          faced was to understand what kinds of metrics must we be measuring in order to increase 
          the efficiency of a system. It is interesting to notice that the article also says that 
          we only measure the variables that are immediate in access. It mentions how we are not measuring 
          parameters that can help us develop insight. This primary leads into understanding what is to be measured, 
          how to generate insight and how we as designers should create visualizations that generate insights and not
           just represent data that is normally collected. How does one create representations from simple 
           logging that enable individuals to derive insight. In both, the leanings I had and the systems 
           mentioned in the article, it’s not about relying on sensors and having a lot of them that capture 
           the data, but it is how the data can be used for analysis and how that can help in improving systems. 
           It also calls on how we start to develop better sensors that give us more accurate and diverse sets of 
           readings that can potentially give us further insights into systems.

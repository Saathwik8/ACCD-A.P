        <h2>Step 1: Idea </h2>
      </div>
      
      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p>The final project's primary purpose was to use the learning acquired across the term to 
            create a new project or expand on a previous one. My idea was to expand on the third project and  
            conduct an experiment on a topic that I wanted to explore. </p>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> It is said that a few compositions in Indian Classical Carnatic music has the same metric and tempo 
            structure has the Vedic chats and mantras. Though these seem to be unrelated fields, the Indian 
            tradition states that the structures used in both are at times similar. The idea was to create a 
            visual method to check the similarity in tempo structures between the mantra chantings and the 
            compositions that are claimed to use those. The idea is to created a way to test this claim.  </p>
      </div>

        <h2>Step 3: Arduino Setup</h2>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> The same MKR 1010 setup was used as the previous project.
            On a sketch_js file the code was being written on.
            Hence it did not take much adjusting to the perviously established project. </p>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <h2>Step 4: Design Idea</h2>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> As the structures of both these system were being used, the design should be able to capture the 
            overall picture - the growth and the fall along with the pressure that it takes. Having a design 
            like the 3rd project that fades would not work, this needed to be logged and it needed to be 
            mapped according to the time as that is the only way it would be useful to compare. It needed 
            to almost represent a graph as only then can the structures be checked. </p>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <h2>Step 5: Drum Design Idea</h2>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> As the same method of input was being used, the same drum made the last time was being used.</p>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <h2>Step 6: Data visualization</h2>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> In order to meet the functional requirements the idea was to indicate a line that would get 
            logged as the the time kept moving. Once we figured that ‘Millis’ was the command that was moving the time, 
            I initiated a variable named timeT that got the value from Millis and made that the 
            moving X value of the line. The input taken from the board/sensor moved the Y value and the color was a 
            gradient created by the amount of pressure. This enabled us to create a continuously growing and 
            logging gradient structure for every metric I played on the drum pad.

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> As the user pushes into the pad , the lines gets logged. The fill also moves from green to red representing how 
            much pressure is applied. This enables one to get a sense of how visually each metric is different / 
            similar from the other. </p>

        <h2>Step 10: Summary </h2>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> When both the representataions are compared it is very interestig to see that
            the patterns and gradientations made for both the compositions are quite similar in nature. Both
            show an alteration cycle as show below. 
         </p>

      <img src="data/T1.png"  class=" w3-padding w3-animate-right" alt="Alps">

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> When these are further expanded we can notice that there is a distinct similarity at nodes between
            each transitions phrase of the beat. Though the redition of the notes are completely different, the sections
            that are claimed to be similar are showing a form of similarity as show below.

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> This can further be abstracted to see that there seems to be a generic patter of the following that is 
            running across both the compositions.
         </p>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> This test primarily supports the claim that the structures used in the Vedic Chat - Rudram and the 
            the ones used on the Composition made my Saint Thygarja are similar in nature.

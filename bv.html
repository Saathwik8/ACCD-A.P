        <h2>Step 1: Idea </h2>
      </div>
      
      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p>The 3rd project's primary purpose is to create a design that takes in values from the 
            sensors and creates visualization to that data. It was designed to make us understand 
            how to abstract data and create  methods to visualize different systems and their interactions in real time. </p>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> After exploring a couple of ideas, my interest fell into the representation of the 
            difference beat and tempo metrics that are used in the Indian classical music system. 
            The Indian classical music runs on different metrics based on the composition and the context. 
            This has mostly been taught through word of mouth and does not really have a visual to represent the system. 
            The idea was to use a sensor to try and create a way of visually showing how the best moves for 
            each of of the metric systems.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Arduino Setup</h2>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> The purpose of the project was to also connect the board to the network so that 
            we can learn how to connect our sensor and system to the internet. Which is why from the Arduino Uno system based 
            on the recommedation of my professor i shifted to the Arduino MKR 1010. This had a wifi module to it. However there were a few problems. 
            Arduino had a very secure system which was not allowing me to connect to the network. 
            Though the connection was established the security protocols did not allow data transfer. 
            This primarily led to a stop as the code was not enabling data to move. 
            The solution that we then came to was to use a Jason file and host it onto just my network. 
            This basically gets the concept of being able to derive the data and host it onto a network 
            but by applying it through the Jason file method enables data to be transferred. It also had a few advatages, thought only accessible by me 
        I was able to push in data at a vary high speed. Using the particle or the other systems would not give me such real time data log, and for my project
    it became apt to have a very fast data transfer. </p>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <h2>Step 4: Design Idea </h2>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> The general way of understanding a beat in my sense was to get to show something that grows. 
            It's to show the repetition of the process. More than just a simple data log to show how,
            the idea was to showcase the pressure of putting the beat along with a representation of how it moves the 
            Y axis as a curve. </p>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <h2>Step 5: Drum design.</h2>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> I started off by just placing a simple cardboard unit on the sensor by using a piece of duck tape to get 
            them together. While experimenting it did give results but not the way it should ideally.
             The impact are was not equally spread across the cardboard. This gave me wrong results. That was when 
             I did some research on how pressure sensor pads actually work. The issue was that the pressure was 
             being distributed and not channelled to the sensor. I then kept a coil and a sponge that puts the
              pressure onto the sensor.  Now as one pushes into the board, it all falls on the sensor making it more accurate. 
              The same learning that I got from the second project , to hold them together I use a rubber band as it 
              hold the unit without changing the pressure distribution. </p>

        <h2>Step 6: Adjusting the scale values.</h2>
      </div>

      <div class=" w3-margin w3-animate-right">
        <p> As the curve being generated was moving outside the focus of the browser - the last step was to get a 
            proper scale factor for the curve. The curve itself had a couple of points that determined how it moves. 
            After figuring out what metrics enabled what parameters - it took a little tinkering to get the exact 
            value of how the curve grows and falls with the background.

        <p> As the user pushes into the pad , the curve grows and falls with a. Fading effect. 
            The Background also moves from green to red representing how much pressure is applied. 
            This enables one to get a sense of how visually each metric is different from the other.
